chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So one addition that wasn't there before was user stories.","startTime":"05:55","endTime":"06:00","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"With acceptance criteria is basically everything we talked about, but with proper technical details.","startTime":"06:00","endTime":"06:07","speaker_name":"ihor

chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You can take a look at them most things.","startTime":"06:16","endTime":"06:19","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So for example, user management.","startTime":"06:20","endTime":"06:22","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I'm a user when I view list, then I should see all registered users.","startTime":"06:23","endTime":"06:28","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Typical.","startTime":"06:28","endTime":"06:29","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But has to be written out because technical people, they work with this.","startTime":"06:29","endTime":"06:34","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right?","startTime":"06:34","endTime":"06:35","speaker_name":"ihor

simple.","startTime":"06:37","endTime":"06:40","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"For example, how many symbols do we need to enter before search works?","startTime":"06:40","endTime":"06:46","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So the amount of symbols you enter, the harder it is for a database.","startTime":"06:46","endTime":"06:53","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It doesn't make sense to search after one symbol because like every symbol you type, you run another search in the database, which is not.","startTime":"06:55","endTime":"07:06","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Not the best.","startTime":"07:07","endTime":"07:08","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"07:08","endTime":"07:09","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But then when you have two or sometimes three, you.","startTime":"07:09","endTime":"07:13","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You will have to decide then search is working properly.","startTime":"07:13","endTime":"07:18","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It makes sense for the starting or for the MVP at least.","startTime":"07:18","endTime":"07:23","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I have written out, let's say common sense, things like that.","startTime":"07:23","endTime":"07:30","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You can look it won't be a problem to change anything.","startTime":"07:30","endTime":"07:34","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But yeah, we have that covered.","startTime":"07:34","endTime":"07:36","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Everything's written out.","startTime":"07:36","endTime":"07:37","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You can, you know, look at it.","startTime":"07:37","endTime":"07:40","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that's done.","startTime":"07:40","endTime":"07:41","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Moving on the structure and the user flows, you've seen the only thing I think I have added.","startTime":"07:41","endTime":"07:51","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So the paywall suggestions and the paywall screen you have seen.","startTime":"07:52","endTime":"07:56","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We'll talk about your AI things.","startTime":"07:56","endTime":"07:59","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The only thing I have added is the marketing website.","startTime":"07:59","endTime":"08:03","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I've sent you the templates you've set, which templates you would like.","startTime":"08:03","endTime":"08:07","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I have included that in here and I have suggestion for pages.","startTime":"08:07","endTime":"08:13","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So as we have with competitors, they do have landing pages which look really terrible.","startTime":"08:13","endTime":"08:22","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I have just worked with AI and it suggested this simple homepage landing page with these sections.","startTime":"08:23","endTime":"08:31","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If you'd like, we can go through them, but that's not the biggest value point of this call.","startTime":"08:31","endTime":"08:36","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I would probably just like have you looking at this afterwards, if that makes sense.","startTime":"08:37","endTime":"08:42","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay, yeah, that makes sense.","startTime":"08:42","endTime":"08:44","speaker_name":"Jalen Wideman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So what we have here is website structure.","startTime":"08:45","endTime":"08:47","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Again, AI is pretty good with marketing stuff because it's trained on mostly marketing things.","startTime":"08:47","endTime":"08:53","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So structure like this typically works, but we can move things around as you would like.","startTime":"08:53","endTime":"08:59","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But this will be 10 times better as those competitors have.","startTime":"08:59","endTime":"09:05","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"09:05","endTime":"09:05","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we have homepage features page pricing page where we have to explain properly the freemium FAQ page.","startTime":"09:06","endTime":"09:13","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It can be either separate page or we can add it somewhere.","startTime":"09:14","endTime":"09:17","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"For SEO, it's better to have separate page, but again not a huge deal.","startTime":"09:18","endTime":"09:23","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So the.","startTime":"09:23","endTime":"09:24","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The for SEO we better have more pages.","startTime":"09:24","endTime":"09:27","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"For user experience,

like.","startTime":"10:04","endTime":"10:06","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"A lot of times I hear from clients, let's have less amount of pages to.","startTime":"10:06","endTime":"10:11","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I've heard this thought.","startTime":"10:13","endTime":"10:14","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If the client doesn't have anything to put here and if it will make them work too hard to generate content, they typically just say yeah, let's remove this page

page.","startTime":"10:29","endTime":"10:33","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It can be super simple, but we have to have that.","startTime":"10:34","endTime":"10:37","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And blog is for future when you will go with SEO marketing.","startTime":"10:37","endTime":"10:44","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's with the Webpage

people do use that.","startTime":"11:54","endTime":"12:01","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And for them the first thing we're starting with is always business case.","startTime":"12:02","endTime":"12:06","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"What we are trying to solve in some marketing stuff.","startTime":"12:06","endTime":"12:10","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I haven't gone too deeply into this.","startTime":"12:11","endTime":"12:13","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I just went with whatever AI.","startTime":"12:14","endTime":"12:16","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I've trained AI.","startTime":"12:16","endTime":"12:17","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I have like a project in Claude and it gave me some information in here.","startTime":"12:17","endTime":"12:23","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I removed the ROI extrapolations and things like that because I don't have the proper confidence or experience to write that at that level.","startTime":"12:23","endTime":"12:36","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But.","startTime":"12:37","endTime":"12:37","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But that's a pretty good starting point for you to even work with investors.","startTime":"12:37","endTime":"12:44","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we basically described what we're trying to solve and how.","startTime":"12:44","endTime":"12:50","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"What are the main.","startTime":"12:50","endTime":"12:51","speaker_name":"ihor

feature, but not your latest addition.","startTime":"13:01","endTime":"13:11","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I know that you want to go into like ecological usage of AI kind of thing.","startTime":"13:11","endTime":"13:17","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we need to redo to add those value points in here to resonate with people.","startTime":"13:17","endTime":"13:24","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"13:24","endTime":"13:25","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right now have that yet and we will need to discuss that.","startTime":"13:25","endTime":"13:29","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But typically things like that AI is pretty good at.","startTime":"13:29","endTime":"13:34","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But our job as people is to remove everything that's not necessary because a lot of times AI just gets too much information which like you want to be as concentrated as possible if you want to present that to investors or partners or train your next.","startTime":"13:34","endTime":"13:56","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So for example, if you want to prepare marketing

chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"14:07","endTime":"14:07","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But that's a good

chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That we have now also in the same way you have to work or we have to work in icp.","startTime":"14:10","endTime":"14:18","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Again, I just gave the first option the first.","startTime":"14:18","endTime":"14:23","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I took whatever AI gave me, I think.","startTime":"14:23","endTime":"14:28","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I'm not sure if we can properly define ICP just yet.","startTime":"14:28","endTime":"14:35","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So if not having any other option, I would go with whatever AI suggests to me the proper way of doing ICP is whenever would be the first, let's say hundred people, user testing group or first, even 50 clients of an app.","startTime":"14:35","endTime":"14:54","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We have to track their usage of an app.","startTime":"14:55","endTime":"14:59","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We have to see who is using our app the most, who is getting the most value, who is the happiest customer, and then define ICP accordingly.","startTime":"14:59","endTime":"15:12","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"15:12","endTime":"15:12","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it.","startTime":"15:13","endTime":"15:14","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So the sum of rule of thumb is there's always 20% of your clients or customers that will give you 80% of revenue and 80% they will be responsible for the best reviews.","startTime":"15:14","endTime":"15:29","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They are the happiest customers and you typically want to focus on them, not focus on everyone.","startTime":"15:29","endTime":"15:35","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You don't want to realize or create features for everyone.","startTime":"15:35","endTime":"15:40","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You want to create features for them.","startTime":"15:41","endTime":"15:43","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because too many features removes the magic from products a lot of times.","startTime":"15:43","endTime":"15:48","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But again, we have starting point.","startTime":"15:49","endTime":"15:51","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's a bit too long.","startTime":"15:51","endTime":"15:53","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think it would better if you could review this, remove everything that you don't think is true, and maybe create something more condensed.","startTime":"15:54","endTime":"16:02","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And by the way, the AI I shared from Hermosis is beautiful.","startTime":"16:02","endTime":"16:09","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Now with that out of the way.","startTime":"16:10","endTime":"16:13","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, I just wanted to share that because that's typically included in the BA process.","startTime":"16:13","endTime":"16:18","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's nothing crazy, but at least we have somewhere to start from.","startTime":"16:18","endTime":"16:22","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right, Right.","startTime":"16:22","endTime":"16:24","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Moving on.","startTime":"16:25","endTime":"16:25","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The final thing is this MEP features prioritized.","startTime":"16:25","endTime":"16:29","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Again, as we talked.","startTime":"16:29","endTime":"16:31","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We have must have.","startTime":"16:31","endTime":"16:33","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Features we have, should have.","startTime":"16:33","endTime":"16:35","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Features we have could have is basically priority levels.","startTime":"16:35","endTime":"16:40","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Everything we talked about.","startTime":"16:40","endTime":"16:42","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And we have things that are not included in the MVP version.","startTime":"16:42","endTime":"16:45","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That is for clarity.","startTime":"16:46","endTime":"16:47","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But the most important part of this is what are we not doing in the first phase?","startTime":"16:48","endTime":"16:55","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that is basically written out in here.","startTime":"16:55","endTime":"16:59","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We will not have sharing communities, social media integrations, friends, recommendations, basically social features.","startTime":"17:00","endTime":"17:07","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We will not have AR and 3D in the first version.","startTime":"17:08","endTime":"17:12","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We will not have offline mode.","startTime":"17:12","endTime":"17:14","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's very important to understand because offline means that we are working inside of.","startTime":"17:14","endTime":"17:20","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So without Internet, we might be able to work offline, for example, to review or pack.","startTime":"17:21","endTime":"17:29","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So packing basically means clicking on things and then changing status.","startTime":"17:29","endTime":"17:34","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We might work.","startTime":"17:34","endTime":"17:35","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We might be able to do that.","startTime":"17:35","endTime":"17:37","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But offline mode is super expensive.","startTime":"17:37","endTime":"17:42","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Why?","startTime":"17:43","endTime":"17:43","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because you have to duplicate the whole backend or at least part of the backend on your mobile phone, which is possible.","startTime":"17:43","endTime":"17:49","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Typically that all is done after mvp.","startTime":"17:50","endTime":"17:53","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right, got you.","startTime":"17:54","endTime":"17:55","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We can go through all of those things, but I think you can review them.","startTime":"17:56","endTime":"18:01","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Basically, I have written out everything we talked about.","startTime":"18:01","endTime":"18:04","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay, so that's like housekeeping kind of thing.","startTime":"18:05","endTime":"18:08","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But let's move on now the most interesting thing would be the frames.","startTime":"18:10","endTime":"18:15","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I prepared the new ones.","startTime":"18:15","endTime":"18:17","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And yeah, we have to talk about the AI thing you sent to me about so we can review that.","startTime":"18:17","endTime":"18:25","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And yeah, by the way, I don't yet have all the estimation for you.","startTime":"18:26","endTime":"18:33","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I will have my lead backend guy told me today that he's not able to finalize the proper estimation today.","startTime":"18:34","endTime":"18:44","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think Monday ish we should have that done.","startTime":"18:45","endTime":"18:48","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I already have the front end and the mobile version, but only of the frames that we talked about before.","startTime":"18:48","endTime":"18:55","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because I have a couple of suggestions which maybe add up things to the estimate.","startTime":"18:55","endTime":"19:02","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I have created this page basically which combines all of these prototypes.","startTime":"19:03","endTime":"19:12","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Now you have seen all of them.","startTime":"19:14","endTime":"19:15","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So the first one is our basically authentication screenshot.","startTime":"19:15","endTime":"19:22","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We have our main screens.","startTime":"19:24","endTime":"19:25","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You can all this so nothing new to you.","startTime":"19:25","endTime":"19:28","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We have our settings, we have our luggage flow and premium paywall.","startTime":"19:29","endTime":"19:36","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"This probably will change after we talk about the AI.","startTime":"19:36","endTime":"19:40","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I have redone the admin panel.","startTime":"19:41","endTime":"19:44","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we talked that we will include.","startTime":"19:44","endTime":"19:46","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we had luggage types, we had airlines, I have added trip types into here.","startTime":"19:46","endTime":"19:52","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So kind of just make it more fancy.","startTime":"19:52","endTime":"19:54","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But right now we have everything we need which is what you've already seen but it was in different screen.","startTime":"19:54","endTime":"20:07","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right now it's just one screen which is convenient.","startTime":"20:07","endTime":"20:09","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But the most important thing is this trip.","startTime":"20:09","endTime":"20:13","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So were talking that when person.","startTime":"20:14","endTime":"20:17","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"By the way, you following?","startTime":"20:18","endTime":"20:20","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"All good if you have comments.","startTime":"20:20","endTime":"20:22","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, we're good.","startTime":"20:22","endTime":"20:23","speaker_name":"Jalen Wideman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We're good.","startTime":"20:23","endTime":"20:24","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you have seen this trip creation thing which is you create a trip, you enter basic things, you select activities, you select luggage, you have weather forecasting and then this packing thing.","startTime":"20:25","endTime":"20:39","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"From here we remove meaning.","startTime":"20:41","endTime":"20:44","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I have worked with better suggestions on AI.","startTime":"20:45","endTime":"20:49","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Now when we get to packing were thinking about two ways.","startTime":"20:49","endTime":"20:56","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"One of them was one step including AI suggestions plus packing.","startTime":"20:56","endTime":"21:01","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And the second way of doing things would be dividing those into more steps, which is one hand not as fast.","startTime":"21:02","endTime":"21:13","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"On the other hand it pro.","startTime":"21:14","endTime":"21:16","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It clearly gives value.","startTime":"21:16","endTime":"21:19","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If we're.","startTime":"21:20","endTime":"21:21","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If we are dividing this step on two sites, first one is AI suggesting items.","startTime":"21:21","endTime":"21:31","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Now for items.","startTime":"21:32","endTime":"21:33","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You remember that in the admin panel.","startTime":"21:33","endTime":"21:35","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Let me do this.","startTime":"21:36","endTime":"21:38","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So in the admin panel we have items.","startTime":"21:43","endTime":"21:48","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we have categories and actual items.","startTime":"21:48","endTime":"21:50","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Every item has name, category, typical or default properties, including weight, including these things.","startTime":"21:51","endTime":"22:03","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it has volume or ease of access priority.","startTime":"22:04","endTime":"22:08","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"These numbers mean that we don't even need AI.","startTime":"22:09","endTime":"22:12","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But AI will be trained on these numbers to give us better suggestions.","startTime":"22:12","endTime":"22:16","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Now AI will be suggesting items to us only from these items that are in here.","startTime":"22:17","endTime":"22:27","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So Here we'll have big list of things.","startTime":"22:27","endTime":"22:29","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And by the way, we didn't include this important documents, but that's super important in like every app.","startTime":"22:30","endTime":"22:38","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we should probably also have like a category of important documents which will be like separate section down there with things like these.","startTime":"22:38","endTime":"22:50","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It also included a little analytics.","startTime":"22:51","endTime":"22:54","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I would not include that in an mvp.","startTime":"22:54","endTime":"22:56","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But that might be super useful if we will add like details like passport validity or expiry

features.","startTime":"23:13","endTime":"23:15","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We might add them later, right?","startTime":"23:15","endTime":"23:17","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But at least to have this section here is super important.","startTime":"23:17","endTime":"23:21","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Now AI imagine this, imagine AI suggests items, they are divided in categories because this is separate step, we can show items divided on those categories.","startTime":"23:21","endTime":"23:39","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Now you can add different numbers of these items.","startTime":"23:40","endTime":"23:44","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You can also add items from the big list that we have in our admin

you.","startTime":"24:22","endTime":"24:22","speaker_name":"Jalen Wideman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, so if you have some item that is custom size or just custom item, you can add it in here.","startTime":"24:23","endTime":"24:32","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you can just add a name.","startTime":"24:32","endTime":"24:33","speaker_name":"ihor

quantities, we can have dimensions.","startTime":"24:54","endTime":"24:58","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And by the way, if a person is not giving dimensions, which is total also fine.","startTime":"24:58","endTime":"25:04","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because a lot of times people don't want to input more

have like super important, super easy instruction.","startTime":"25:21","endTime":"25:27","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Meaning how important is compact packing for this

here.","startTime":"25:45","endTime":"25:51","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And simple volume capacity tracker looks good to me.","startTime":"25:51","endTime":"26:00","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But we want to add packing suggestions for items, which is a thought.","startTime":"26:00","endTime":"26:07","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Now let's move to another one.","startTime":"26:07","endTime":"26:09","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Another one is compartments.","startTime":"26:09","endTime":"26:11","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Now compartments Again, we

categories.","startTime":"26:17","endTime":"26:18","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We didn't have compartments because compartments like we have to think about how to properly do it.","startTime":"26:18","endTime":"26:26","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we need some kind of constructor, meaning this luggage has one main compartment

like only for documents.","startTime":"26:30","endTime":"27:03","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So what I'm thinking, we have to create like another set of fields for compartments and we have to think about which compartment types do we have.","startTime":"27:04","endTime":"27:15","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We have ones that are kind of inside and the ones outside.","startTime":"27:16","endTime":"27:20","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I like what AI suggested in here.","startTime":"27:21","endTime":"27:23","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we have main compartment which will be default for everyone.","startTime":"27:23","endTime":"27:26","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But we also have front zippered pocket or internal divider pocket or something like that.","startTime":"27:26","endTime":"27:33","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we'll need to think that.","startTime":"27:34","endTime":"27:36","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But we have to be able to add those in admin panel once we do.","startTime":"27:36","endTime":"27:43","speaker_name":"ihor

compartments.","startTime":"27:55","endTime":"27:57","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We can just start with main.","startTime":"27:57","endTime":"27:59","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But if you want you can put it in the luggage section.","startTime":"27:59","endTime":"28:02","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Now also we can have either just one or multiple things that we're taking with our

chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we can have those items that we had before divided between compartments and suggested with AI.","startTime":"28:12","endTime":"28:22","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"28:24","endTime":"28:24","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Which is, let's say the, the simplest version of this would be just one compartment and everything inside.","startTime":"28:24","endTime":"28:32","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But if you have two, you can move things from here to this lower thing.","startTime":"28:32","endTime":"28:37","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"28:37","endTime":"28:37","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Also, I think before we were talking about this flow and we select.","startTime":"28:38","endTime":"28:49","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, we don't have a volume or access selection here.","startTime":"28:50","endTime":"28:54","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We have this selection like this.","startTime":"28:57","endTime":"28:59","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So probably we will need to have separate screen or selection before.","startTime":"29:00","endTime":"29:04","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Well, maybe where do you think this screen should go after AI suggest items but before packing.","startTime":"29:05","endTime":"29:16","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Does that make sense?","startTime":"29:18","endTime":"29:19","speaker_name":"ihor

got.","startTime":"29:33","endTime":"29:36","speaker_name":"Jalen Wideman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, we'll go trip details, then activities, then luggage, then Weiser and then right here we have first item which would be.","startTime":"29:39","endTime":"29:49","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Sorry, which would be this.","startTime":"29:50","endTime":"29:54","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We have all items.","startTime":"29:54","endTime":"29:55","speaker_name":"ihor

we have this and then we have this.","startTime":"30:02","endTime":"30:13","speaker_name":"ihor

just.","startTime":"30:32","endTime":"30:35","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We can just move whatever we named in this step.","startTime":"30:35","endTime":"30:40","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We can just move around

chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think it would be cool to drag items, but I mean to add items.","startTime":"30:44","endTime":"30:51","speaker_name":"Jalen Wideman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think adding items is.","startTime":"30:51","endTime":"30:53","speaker_name":"Jalen Wideman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So.","startTime":"30:56","endTime":"30:57","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So just because what if we move something to a compartment that won't fit?","startTime":"30:57","endTime":"31:03","speaker_name":"Jalen Wideman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You know, like, if you like, it should be an option, I guess, a parameter that the Blazer should not be able to fit in the front zipper pocket, you know?","startTime":"31:03","endTime":"31:12","speaker_name":"Jalen Wideman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Mm.","startTime":"31:12","endTime":"31:13","speaker_name":"Jalen Wideman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Well, you see, what we can do with compartments is we can set up volume.","startTime":"31:14","endTime":"31:19","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then if.","startTime":"31:21","endTime":"31:22","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Let's say Blazer has higher volume than this compartment, it won't fit.","startTime":"31:23","endTime":"31:28","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And by the way, we can have margins.","startTime":"31:28","endTime":"31:29","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So, for example, if the compartment is 2 liters and then the blazer is 1 and 5.","startTime":"31:29","endTime":"31:35","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"1.5, we can say, hey, that's pretty.","startTime":"31:35","endTime":"31:38","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, you're taking up too much.","startTime":"31:38","endTime":"31:40","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And we can have.","startTime":"31:41","endTime":"31:42","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, if that's above 70%, then we.","startTime":"31:42","endTime":"31:45","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We give them a caution.","startTime":"31:45","endTime":"31:46","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But for fitting or not fitting, this was the biggest problem.","startTime":"31:47","endTime":"31:53","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I've taken this to my team, and my team said that the highest value they see is AI or app showing exactly where to put things.","startTime":"31:53","endTime":"32:05","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But to do that, we have to count actual volumes in, like, little squares, which is a lot of math.","startTime":"32:06","endTime":"32:15","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I told them that this version most likely don't include proper math in terms of this shoes or these shoes will fit or not fit.","startTime":"32:17","endTime":"32:31","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"What we're trying to do is just to see if the volume fits.","startTime":"32:31","endTime":"32:36","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They say that, like, were fighting a lot, and they say that you.","startTime":"32:38","endTime":"32:46","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You want to.","startTime":"32:46","endTime":"32:47","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You want to do this properly with math, but math is, like, huge problem to solve, which is possible, but, like, it takes a ton of research.","startTime":"32:47","endTime":"32:58","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I cannot include this in this.","startTime":"32:58","endTime":"33:00","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Mvp, I wanted to discuss this with you.","startTime":"33:00","endTime":"33:04","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So my guys say that they don't even.","startTime":"33:05","endTime":"33:07","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They cannot even say estimation on how long it will take.","startTime":"33:07","endTime":"33:12","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right?","startTime":"33:13","endTime":"33:13","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you have to, like, do the proper research, which can be, you know, 200 hours or 100 hours or something like that.","startTime":"33:13","endTime":"33:22","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But what we can do and what we are estimating is we will have basic logic in terms of volume, but we have to have the SVG version of this luggage open.","startTime":"33:23","endTime":"33:40","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then again, I showed you the three kind of levels of things which won't be valuable.","startTime":"33:40","endTime":"33:51","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we will need to have some kind of SVG file.","startTime":"33:51","endTime":"33:55","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So let's say shoes, right?","startTime":"33:55","endTime":"33:57","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We know that we have.","startTime":"33:57","endTime":"33:59","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So mathematically, we have this open luggage, we have this item, this SVG of choose.","startTime":"34:01","endTime":"34:12","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And by the way, we can have them to be stored in different ways.","startTime":"34:12","endTime":"34:16","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We can put them like this.","startTime":"34:16","endTime":"34:18","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We can put them like this.","startTime":"34:18","endTime":"34:19","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So all of those ways we have to be able to include in our admin panel.","startTime":"34:19","endTime":"34:25","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Let me go to admin Panel.","startTime":"34:27","endTime":"34:28","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it appears that items, they don't even have one SVG, they have one SVG for item, but they will also have different SVGs for how they are packed.","startTime":"34:29","endTime":"34:44","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So, for example, T shirt, it can be rolled or it can be packed.","startTime":"34:44","endTime":"34:48","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Two different things.","startTime":"34:48","endTime":"34:48","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And we can have.","startTime":"34:48","endTime":"34:50","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we should have multiple types of folding or packing.","startTime":"34:50","endTime":"34:55","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And for each of those we have to have svg.","startTime":"34:56","endTime":"34:58","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And also I was thinking that it might be helpful we can prepare little animations.","startTime":"34:59","endTime":"35:04","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So for example, the person doesn't know how to pack, how to fold, or say a T shirt.","startTime":"35:04","endTime":"35:09","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right?","startTime":"35:09","endTime":"35:10","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay, we can do a little animation.","startTime":"35:10","endTime":"35:13","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Not sure if that's

sure.","startTime":"35:19","endTime":"35:21","speaker_name":"Jalen Wideman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So what we can do is, for example.","startTime":"35:21","endTime":"35:27","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Well, the problem that I still don't see how we can solve is, for example, we optimize for volume, right?","startTime":"35:28","endTime":"35:36","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But then shirt, it can be either rolled or it can be layered or folded, right?","startTime":"35:37","endTime":"35:45","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"How do we decide?","startTime":"35:46","endTime":"35:48","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Rolled or folded?","startTime":"35:48","endTime":"35:50","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because once we decide, we can let AI decide.","startTime":"35:50","endTime":"35:53","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But AI doesn't have the proper 3D image of items.","startTime":"35:54","endTime":"36:01","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"What it has is volume and

chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So.","startTime":"36:06","endTime":"36:07","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So AI kind of understand that you can either pack things in here or.","startTime":"36:07","endTime":"36:12","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, so that.","startTime":"36:13","endTime":"36:15","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That is the logic.","startTime":"36:15","endTime":"36:16","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And my guys, I was saying that to guys,

chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So what I'm thinking is like if we're looking in here, we have shoes, let's say in 2D and we know that we have two pair of shoes looks like this, but it also takes up to three items on top.","startTime":"42:00","endTime":"42:21","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That means that we can either use this space for four layers, but this space only for two layers kind of thing.","startTime":"42:28","endTime":"42:40","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that's what I'm.","startTime":"42:41","endTime":"42:42","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I'm thinking another way, like we can go even simpler, but I'm not sure this mess

that.","startTime":"43:04","endTime":"43:07","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So for example, we can have yeah.","startTime":"43:07","endTime":"43:09","speaker_name":"ihor

the.","startTime":"43:19","endTime":"43:20","speaker_name":"Jalen Wideman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"In the 2D model, it would make sense to maybe change the color of the layer to show people that

that would.","startTime":"43:38","endTime":"43:39","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then we only work with the top

chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right, right.","startTime":"43:51","endTime":"43:53","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then we build layer by layer.","startTime":"43:57","endTime":"43:59","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that means.","startTime":"43:59","endTime":"44:00","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That means that we basically work with four layers, which we can just draw like this.","startTime":"44:01","endTime":"44:07","speaker_name":"ihor

that's.","startTime":"44:10","endTime":"44:11","speaker_name":"Jalen Wideman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then if we put shoes in here, we basically put shoes in here and in here, which

layer.","startTime":"44:34","endTime":"44:35","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If that's rolled, that will typically take up to two layers.","startTime":"44:35","endTime":"44:38","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Well, even this, I think, is a lot of math to figure out.","startTime":"44:41","endTime":"44:47","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But let's do this.","startTime":"44:48","endTime":"44:49","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Let me feed it into AI and figure out how we can do this in the easiest way possible.","startTime":"44:49","endTime":"44:56","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I'm thinking AI can easily.","startTime":"44:57","endTime":"45:00","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Well, yeah, actually, I'm thinking we can just have layers.","startTime":"45:00","endTime":"45:09","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, layers and compartments.","startTime":"45:11","endTime":"45:14","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And depending on the width, we can have these layers of different kind of sickness.","startTime":"45:14","endTime":"45:25","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that means.","startTime":"45:28","endTime":"45:29","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So if something is super wide, then we can have like five layers.","startTime":"45:30","endTime":"45:36","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If something is super thin, it can have three layers.","startTime":"45:37","endTime":"45:41","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay, Right.","startTime":"45:43","endTime":"45:46","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Does that make sense?","startTime":"45:46","endTime":"45:47","speaker_name":"ihor

sense.","startTime":"45:49","endTime":"45:50","speaker_name":"Jalen Wideman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But number of layers is kind of tricky.","startTime":"45:50","endTime":"45:53","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I'm not sure what's easier to add more layers because of new colors or to change the width of a layer.","startTime":"45:55","endTime":"46:04","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because maybe we always have four layers.","startTime":"46:04","endTime":"46:07","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But then these layers are one inch deep, and this layer is just half.","startTime":"46:07","endTime":"46:13","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And another luggage layers are just half of an inch deep.","startTime":"46:14","endTime":"46:21","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I'm thinking it's easier to have another.","startTime":"46:23","endTime":"46:25","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"To have multiple layers.","startTime":"46:25","endTime":"46:29","speaker_name":"ihor

guys.","startTime":"46:50","endTime":"46:52","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But most likely they will say that this will be a lot of research, a lot of math to figure out.","startTime":"46:52","endTime":"47:01","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Or I will take this to AI.","startTime":"47:01","endTime":"47:03","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So what I'm trying to say is I have everything clear to actually hand off the proper BA project to

a little button like show me how to roll and then maybe like a pop up or even here or like a model window and just a shirt and it shows.","startTime":"47:35","endTime":"47:46","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You turn it around, you fold.","startTime":"47:46","endTime":"47:48","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, I like that.","startTime":"47:48","endTime":"47:49","speaker_name":"Jalen Wideman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I like that.","startTime":"47:49","endTime":"47:50","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And you can upload that in the admin panel.","startTime":"47:50","endTime":"47:54","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it will require a lot of work creating those.","startTime":"47:54","endTime":"47:57","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But again AI will create whatever you

this.","startTime":"51:00","endTime":"51:02","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I'm just thinking, not sure if that's possible, but that's what where I would go.","startTime":"51:02","endTime":"51:06","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Imagine we have SVG of absolute dimension of shoes basically right.","startTime":"51:06","endTime":"51:15","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we have SVG and we have this layer.","startTime":"51:18","endTime":"51:21","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So looking from top, SVG looks like this.","startTime":"51:24","endTime":"51:28","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it occupies exact number of

thinking.","startTime":"51:32","endTime":"51:36","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I understand why my guys are saying we could probably.","startTime":"51:38","endTime":"51:45","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Let's say we have shoes and we have some rolled things and we have a computer like this

sense.","startTime":"53:32","endTime":"53:34","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But then you put something small in here and you do have some place for T

telling me, yeah, give me the proper task requirement.","startTime":"57:34","endTime":"57:39","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I'm saying like, just make it work.","startTime":"57:39","endTime":"57:41","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And they say, no, tell me what approach to take, how to do exactly.","startTime":"57:41","endTime":"57:46","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I cannot estimate without exact.","startTime":"57:46","endTime":"57:48","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So let me take this to my guys and

work.","startTime":"58:05","endTime":"58:06","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I will ask them what can we do in

chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Why?","startTime":"58:28","endTime":"58:29","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because it actually makes sense to start with something

yeah.","startTime":"58:38","endTime":"58:40","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay, so that was this.","startTime":"58:41","endTime":"58:44","speaker_name":"ihor

you want to have something like tokens.","startTime":"59:02","endTime":"59:10","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Can you explain that?","startTime":"59:10","endTime":"59:11","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And what does token mean?","startTime":"59:11","endTime":"59:13","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Is token just one generation.","startTime":"59:13","endTime":"59:16","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So what I mean by tokens is I would like.","startTime":"59:18","endTime":"59:24","speaker_name":"Jalen Wideman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because like you said, clearly, everything that you've shown me within the wireframe

there.","startTime":"59:38","endTime":"59:40","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It won't be a lot of AI because we have predictable input and predictable

chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But it's not like huge amount.","startTime":"59:51","endTime":"59:53","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Just for your

this.","startTime":"01:00:07","endTime":"01:00:16","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Now, what does one token mean?","startTime":"01:00:17","endTime":"01:00:19","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because, you know, like, there's this token as set of symbols in AI, which everyone counts by tokens, and it costs, like you have 10,000 tokens for free every day kind of thing.","startTime":"01:00:19","endTime":"01:00:39","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So.","startTime":"01:00:39","endTime":"01:00:40","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay, so we have to be cautious with this logic at least.","startTime":"01:00:40","endTime":"01:00:44","speaker_name":"ihor chalapchi","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So maybe AI generation is better because to generate a picture, you only can have three

we.","startTime":"01:02:01","endTime":"01:02:06","speaker_name":"Jalen Wideman","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Can have something like.","startTime":"01:02:06","endTime":"01:02:08","speaker_name":"ihor
